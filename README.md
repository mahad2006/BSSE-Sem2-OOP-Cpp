## 🧐 About This Repository

This is my personal codebase for the **Object-Oriented Programming (CS-352)** course. 

It contains my rewriting of the examples and solution codes for the exercises from **Robert Lafore’s "Object-Oriented Programming in C++"**, fully adapted to meet the specific requirements of the **UBIT BSSE curriculum**.

## ✨ Code Standards

Unlike standard student repositories, every class in this repository is built with a **professional 5-Function Protocol** to ensure data encapsulation and robustness:

| Function Type | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Constructor** | Initializes object state immediately upon creation. |
| **2. Destructor** | Clean memory management and resource release. |
| **3. Setter** | Safe data input and validation. |
| **4. Getter** | Controlled data access (using `cin`/`cout` logic). |
| **5. Show()** | Standardized display method for debugging and output. |

### 🧩 Additional Features:
* **Complete Coverage:** Includes solution code for **In-Chapter Examples** and **End-of-Chapter Exercises**.
* **Modular Architecture:** Code is strictly separated into `examples/` (theory) and `exercises/` (labs) for every chapter.
* **Clean Formatting:** Proper indentation and meaningful variable naming used throughout.

## 🛠️ How to Run

If you are a student using this for reference, here is how to use these files:

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  Open the folder in your preferred IDE (VS Code, DevC++, or CLion).
3.  Navigate to the specific chapter (e.g., `Chapter-06-Objects-and-Classes/exercises`).

## 💡 Note to Future Students

If you are a junior from UBIT or a fellow student reading this:
> **"Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking."**

Use this repository to understand the *logic* and *syntax*, but always try to write the code yourself first. The "5-Function Protocol" used here is a great habit to build early in your career!

The solutions provided here are my own interpretations of the exercises. Students are encouraged to use this as a reference but should write their own code to ensure true learning.
